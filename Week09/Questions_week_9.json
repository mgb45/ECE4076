        "answer": "It diverges to infinity.",
        "correct": false,
        "feedback": "Incorrect. Himmelblau’s function is smooth and bounded near (0, 0); divergence would usually only happen if the learning rate is too large."

        "answer": "It oscillates without converging.",
        "correct": false,
        "feedback": "Incorrect. Oscillations can occur if the learning rate is too high, but with a reasonable value, gradient descent will typically converge from this point."

        "answer": "It immediately reaches a saddle point.",

        "answer": "It follows the same path as starting from (0, 0).",
